# Sediment Biogeochemistry {#candi-aed}

## Overview {#sediment-overview}

The store of carbon and nitrogen in marine sediments can be a major factor
controlling coastal water quality. A significant fraction of organic material
that deposits into sediments is recycled and often re-released back to the
water column as inorganic, bioavailable nutrients, which can subsequently fuel
primary productivity. The remainder can be assimilated via processes such as
denitrification, or buried into deeper sediments.

This cycling and movement of materials in surficial sediments, termed *early
diagenesis*, is highly dynamic and regulated by temperature, $O_2$ availability
and physical processes acting at the sediment–water interface. In many coastal
ecosystems, early diagenesis is further complicated by macroinvertebrate
bioturbation and the presence of aquatic vegetation. 

The sharp redox gradient that typifies coastal sediments causes a complex
series of chemical reactions, mediated by diverse microbial communities, and
occurring over timescales from days to decades. This complexity makes it
difficult to quantify the pathways of incoming nutrients and the extent of
nutrient recycling. 

In coastal zones, high inputs of organic carbon and nutrients to the sediment
may arise from **autochthonous** sources (e.g. phytoplankton, benthic algae,
seagrass) and **allochthonous** sources (e.g. catchment-derived material).
In highly polluted systems, long-term deposition can build a legacy pool of
carbon and nutrients and establish biogeochemical conditions that promote
O\_2 consumption and, in extreme cases, H\_2S production.

Specifically within Cockburn Sound, the legacy loading of wastewater and industrial
effluents from the 1950s to the 1980s led to excessive primary production and
nutrient enrichment of naturally sandy sediments. Construction of the Garden
Island causeway in the 1970s reduced the rate at which nutrients were flushed
from Cockburn Sound to the open ocean (Zhou *et al.* 2024).

Water quality has been monitored for decades and has improved following
reductions in point-source nutrient inputs, such as wastewater treatment
plants. Nonetheless, the sediments within and surrounding Cockburn Sound
retain a legacy store of nutrients that may still supply bioavailable N and P
to the water column. The relative importance of these sediment sources,
compared to contemporary external inputs, has remained uncertain. Sediment cores analysed 
by Zhou *et al.* (2024) revealed a nutrient
accumulation history spanning roughly the last 100 years. Lead isotopes were
used to date ~70 cm of sediment, implying an average sedimentation rate
of ~0.5 cm y^-1. The upper 6–10 cm were characterised as a mixed layer with no
clear isotopic signature, consistent with physical mixing and/or bioturbation.
Below this layer, clear step changes in nutrient concentrations were observed:
low values prior to the 1950s, an increase in the 1950s (linked to water-column
pollution), and a further increase in the 1980s (associated with the causeway).
Despite reductions in nutrient inputs since the 1980s, nutrient concentrations
in the surface mixed layer remain highest, suggesting a shift to a higher
nutrient state that may be difficult to reverse.

O\_2 concentrations measured in the water column show that Cockburn Sound is
generally well oxygenated, but can become hypoxic in the deep basin (around
20 m) during periods of high temperature and low wind, when mixing with the
atmosphere is reduced. Dalseno *et al.* (2024) recorded bottom-water O\_2
as low as 0.08 mmol L^-1, while shallower waters remained around 0.22 mmol
L^-1. They concluded that sediment O\_2 demand and DIC release drive these
episodes. When the water column is well mixed, O\_2 is nearly uniform from
surface to bottom, indicating that the system can maintain oxygenation under
typical conditions, but is vulnerable to hypoxia under changes in wind or
temperature regimes.

Groundwater nutrient inputs to Cockburn Sound have been measured by CSIRO
(Donn *et al.* 2025), with samples collected at 113 beach sites and 35 offshore
sites. These include measurements of NH\_4^+, NO\_3^- and dissolved organic
nitrogen (DON), as well as flow rates from shore through the subsurface and
into the sediment beneath Cockburn Sound.

Recent work by Eyre *et al.* has collected sediment cores and grab samples at
twelve sites in Cockburn Sound and measured sediment–water fluxes in incubated
cores. The study provides baseline rates of respiration and gross primary
production, and highlights the importance of benthic algae and seagrass for
coupled nitrification–denitrification and permanent removal of N as N\_2.

### Cockburn Sound nutrient budget uncertainty {#cockburn-sound-budget-uncertainty}

To better understand nutrient cycling in Cockburn Sound, several nutrient
budgets have been developed.

Greenwood *et al.* (2016) used a **box model** to estimate an N budget,
including major pools and fluxes between them. They concluded that historical
excess N inputs are now largely recycled internally among phytoplankton,
detritus and inorganic N species (Table \@ref(tab:greenwood-budget)).

  ),
  caption = "Summary of N flux budget components in Cockburn Sound from Greenwood et al. (2016)."
)
```

Greenwood et al. (2016) emphasised four key uncertainties:

1. **Groundwater inputs** – groundwater loads were estimated with a wide range,
   driven by rainfall variability and uncertain N concentrations.
2. **Denitrification** – denitrified and buried N were inferred as a residual
   between inputs (including uncertain groundwater) and export to the ocean.
   Estimated denitrification rates were at the lower end of literature values
   for coastal shelf environments.
3. **Burial vs denitrification** – burial and denitrification were combined and
   not resolved separately.
4. **DIN speciation** – the budget assumed net sediment fluxes of NO\_3^- only,
   with no NH\_4^+ release from sediments.

Sediment N and C stocks have been estimated by multiple studies using different
data and assumptions, with results summarised in tables below.

### Aims and scope {#aims-scope}

Despite substantial research on sediment quality in Cockburn Sound and Perth
coastal waters, several knowledge gaps remain:

1. The magnitude of fluxes across the sediment–water interface.
2. The seasonal variability of these fluxes.
3. The rates of processing and cycling of C and nutrients within sediments.
4. The contribution of sediment fluxes to the broader ecosystem nutrient budget.

Proposed changes in Cockburn Sound associated with port development, together
with regional changes linked to marine heatwaves and climate change, provide a
strong impetus to improve understanding of sediment biogeochemistry and to
develop modelling tools that can be coupled to 3D hydrodynamic–biogeochemical
models for decision support.

The aim of this study is to synthesise available sediment quality data for
Cockburn Sound and surrounding waters and to use this synthesis to guide
development of a sediment biogeochemistry model capable of resolving inputs,
processes and fluxes across the sediment–water interface.

The specific objectives are:

- To develop a sediment early diagenesis model capable of resolving key sediment
  functions and accurately simulating nutrient recycling, attenuation and burial.
- To apply the sediment model to resolve variability in sediment–water O\_2,
  carbon and nutrient fluxes among different sediment types.
- To complete a sediment biogeochemical budget for carbon, nutrients and related
  compounds under present-day conditions.
- To assess the role of legacy nutrients in shaping present-day sediment and
  water-column conditions.

The model developed here is implemented as a module within the Cockburn Sound
Integrated Ecosystem Model (CSIEM), using an adapted version of CANDI-AED.



## Model Description and Approach {#model-description}

### Overview {#overview-approach}

A large dataset of sediment cores and grab samples was available to support
sediment model setup. The key tasks were to:

1. Synthesise the available sediment and flux data.
2. Develop a conceptual model suitable for implementation in CANDI-AED.
3. Configure and calibrate CANDI-AED to represent the dominant Cockburn Sound
   sediment environments.

### Sediment biogeochemistry model (CANDI-AED) {#candi-aed}

CANDI-AED is a one-dimensional reaction–transport model of sediment
biogeochemistry. It simulates vertical profiles of sediment solutes and solids
by solving advection–diffusion–reaction equations with depth. The main
chemical reactions are driven by microbial degradation of organic matter,
coupled to a series of redox processes.

The model domain extends from the sediment–water interface to a specified depth
(e.g. 30 cm), and is forced at the upper boundary by bottom-water concentrations
and fluxes, and at the lower boundary by burial and porewater advection.

A full description of the core CANDI-AED equations and parameterisation is
given in the AED manual (Chapter 14):

- <https://aquaticecodynamics.github.io/aed-science/>

Existing CANDI-like models in the literature largely focus on offshore
sediments and do not represent some key features of Cockburn Sound, such as
shallow benthic algae and seagrass habitats. In this work we:

- outline the available data used to constrain the model;
- develop a conceptual model of sediment dynamics tailored to Cockburn Sound;
- describe the specific CANDI-AED configuration used; and
- apply the model to contrasting sediment environments.

### Categorisation of sediment types {#sediment-types}

Eyre *et al.*’s twelve core sites were broadly categorised as:

- **Deep** sites that do not receive light for photosynthesis, and  
- **Shallow** sites (often with seagrass) that do.

Shallow areas are apparent in aerial imagery of Cockburn Sound. Cores collected
by Zhou (*CS13*) were spatially close to one of Eyre’s deep muddy cores, while
another core (*MB*) was close to a shallow Eyre core.

Of Eyre’s 12 sites, four were in deep areas and eight in shallow areas. Two
shallow sites (7 and 8) did not have seagrass. Although shallow sites were
more numerous, the deep areas occupy a larger fraction of Cockburn Sound’s
area, making them particularly important for system-scale budgets. At the same
time, seagrass and benthic algae habitats are critical from an ecological
perspective and for understanding coupled nitrification–denitrification.

Core descriptions indicate that most sediments are sandy, with well-mixed
upper 10 cm, and grey with occasional black patches, consistent with limited
sulfate-reducing “muddy ooze”.

Based on observations from 14 cores, four major sediment environments were
defined (from offshore to nearshore):

1. Offshore – dark oligotrophic  
2. Deep-dark  
3. Shelf with benthic algae communities  
4. Shelf with seagrass

Cross section of the sediment and water, from the deep sea off the shelf on the left, to the shallow waters that are affected by groundwater on the right. Red rectangles indicate a 1D sediment profile representing that environment.

The main differences among these environments are in light availability,
organic matter loading and organic matter sources (Table \@ref(tab:env-inputs)).

    check.names = FALSE
  ),
  caption = "Main inputs that define the four major types of sediment environment in the greater Cockburn Sound region."

```

Expected differences in DIC, O_2 and denitrification among environments are
summarised in Table @ref(tab:env-outputs).

```{r tab:env-outputs, echo=FALSE}

  data.frame(
    ID   = c("1", "2", "3", "4"),

  ),

```


The differences between the inputs to these environments were refined to characteristics of light and organic matter (Table 1). The expected differences in the major outputs of DIC, O2 and denitrification for each of the four environments are summarised in Table 2.

Table 4 Main inputs that define the four major types of sediment environment

Table 5 Major outputs of each sediment environment

Offshore sediment samples were not collected as part of this study and so they are not a focus in this report. For future modelling purposes, standard values and assumptions from the sediment modelling literature are appropriate. Thus, the next three sections outline the major descriptions of the Deep-dark, Benthic algae and Seagrass environments. The Benthic algae and Seagrass environments required water shallow enough to allow photosynthesis, and so they were only present on the shelf. They also hosted communities of benthic algae and seagrasses. For brevity, they are referred to as ‘Benthic algae’ and ‘Seagrass’, rather than more accurately describing them each time as, say, ‘Shelf-based benthic algal communities’ and ‘Shelf-based seagrass communities’.

To provide context for the relative amounts of each environment in Cockburn sound, an estimate was made of their areas. The habitat suitability index (HSI) was used, from the project on seagrass habitat and biomass dynamics (see the seagrass habitable area chapter). HSI refers to the suitability of seagrass habitat, scaling from 0 (unsuitable) to 1 (suitable), accounting for many factors including light environment (depth, turbidity), wave exposure, substrate etc. For this calculation, the light component of HSI was used such that values less than 0.5 were classified as having too little light for photosynthesis, and therefore being in the Deep-dark environment. The choice of an HSI cutoff of 0.5 was consistent with the methodology of Zhai et al. in the seagrass habitat project and was a suitable method for simplifying the whole environment into categories of either suitable or not suitable. Estimated seagrass extent from seagrass surveys (see the chapter on Seagrass Habitable Area) were then designated as the Seagrass environment. Any area with a light HSI greater than 0.5 but not falling in the seagrass survey area was designated as the Benthic algae environment. Note that the Benthic algae habitat was not based on surveys of benthic algae, and there is uncertainty over all of the factors that contribute to benthic algae suitability. Nonetheless, this represented a suitable light environment and was consistent with the core data from Eyre et al.

Figure 2 Left – Cockburn Sound with aerial photograph. Shallower areas are visible as paler blue. Core sites are red and yellow circles; Right – cores and major sediment environments.

This approach allowed an update of the sediment storage budget (Table 7). The areas from Table 6 were applied as weighted averages to the % sediment measurements from Eyre et al. (2024). Two deep cores had high % organic C (1.41 and 1.85) and since the deep area is 67% of the total, the final organic C budget estimate is much higher using this method. At close to 40 000 t, this is higher than the simple average method, closer to 30 000 t, and the estimate made here from Keesing et al. (2011), closer to 10 000 t. The TN estimate using this weighted method is similar to the simple average, around 5000 t.

### Sediment model simulation setup

Initial simulation setup

Concentrations for O2, NH4+, NO3-, PO43-, salinity and SO42- from recent years were simulated using the output of the water column model. It used a one-way coupling approach, where the bottom water concentrations and fluxes were written to a file then loaded into the sediment model (Figure 9). The organic matter from the water column model was multiplied until it gave an average of around 8500 mmol m-2 y-1, which retained the seasonality of the water column model but gave the assumed organic matter input from the measured cores.

![image5.png](media/candi/image5.png){width="95%"}

Figure 3 Schematic of the initial sediment modelling approach. The water column model was run. Its bottom water results were exported to a file then loaded into the sediment model.

Other boundary values were set using standard values from the literature. This included MnO2A and Fe(OH)3A fluxes, and bottom water DIC, N2 and N2O concentrations (Table 3).

A 30 cm sediment was simulated with 400 equally-sized vertical layers (0.75 mm each). (Results plots below zoom in to the top 20 or 15 cm of these 30 cm.) According to Zhou et al. (2024) 30 cm depth corresponded to a date of around 1992. The model was run with time steps of one day. Bioturbation was set to 50 cm2 y-1 at the sediment-water interface, decaying exponentially to 0 with depth at 8 cm deep. A spin-up period of 5 years was used, with constant boundary fluxes and concentrations, to allow the system to reach equilibrium before using a dynamic boundary. The dynamic boundary was the output from the initial water column model simulations, written to a file then was loaded in as the upper boundary of the sediment model, rather than a dynamic boundary (Figure 10).

Table 8 Summary of key variables and their boundary conditions

Figure 4 Illustration of the simulation approach. A constant average value for 5 years for spinup then a time-varying sediment boundary.

Organic matter setup

CANDI-AED has options for a simple or complex set of organic matter species and reactions (OMModel = 1 or 2). The simple method was chosen, with the aim that the complex method could be used in future work. With this method, two particulate species, labile and refractory, degrade straight to DIC and release NH4+ and PO43-, and there are no dissolved organic species (Figure 11). A third phase of POMspecial was optionally added, in this case to simulate seagrass detritus and a one-off organic matter bloom.

![image6.png](media/candi/image6.png){width="95%"}

Figure 5 Overall organic matter oxidation process using the setting OMModel = 1.

POMR was calibrated to reach an equilibrium so that sediment TOC% in the top 10 cm was around 5000 mmol L-1 solids.

Calibrating organic carbon involved the result of balancing three key components of organic matter: influx, initial concentration profile and reaction rate (Figure 14). The target was a steady concentration profile and a DIC efflux of around 8500 mmol m-2 y-1. The organic matter reaction rate constant was set to 2 y-1. Greenwood et al. (2016) had estimated a rate of 0.73 y-1, which they compared to the range of estimated degradation rates 0.365 to 3.65 y-1 from Wijsman et al. (2002) and Greenwood (2010). Middelburg et al. (2019) estimated a general rate of degradation based on organic matter age, which gave around 2.4 for organic matter one month old, and 0.2 for one year old.

![image7.png](media/candi/image7.png){width="95%"}

Figure 6 Illustration of the three major calibration inputs for organic matter: POML influx, the initial concentration profile and the kinetic reaction rate constant.

O2 penetration

Photos from Eyre et al. (2025) suggested that O2 penetrated most of cores 2, 3 and 4, but the amount of bioturbation was not clear. The Pb isotope work from Zhou et al. (2024) indicated a mixed depth to 6 or 10 cm, which suggests that O2 should be mixed to around 8 cm, either by physical mixing or bioturbation. Keesing et al. (2011) reported sediment samples from six sites in Cockburn Sound, with an anaerobic sand depth of 1, 1.5, 2 and 1 cm, as well as one site where the sand appeared aerobic at greater than 10 cm, and one site where the depth could not be determined. Jorgensen et al. (2022) developed an empirical formula for O2 penetration depth (OPD) based on diffusive O2 uptake (DOU), as well as another empirical formula for DOU based on water depth. This 20 m deep environment should have an OPD of around 2 cm. There is enough spatial heterogeneity from these studies that one overall OPD cannot be determined, however, O2 to at least 2 cm is justified.

Denitrification model

The traditional sediment models that CANDI-AED was based on have an N redox model that resembles that in Figure 13. In broad terms, NH4+ is oxidised by O2 to NO3- (red pathway) and in the absence of O2, NO3- oxidises organic matter, producing N2 as a by product. Since the N2 is chemically inert (N-fixation is usually not included in sediment models) it leaves the N redox cycle, hence the term denitrification.

![image8.png](media/candi/image8.png){width="95%"}

Figure 7 Nitrogen redox model used in most sediment models.

CANDI-AED has a complex nitrogen redox model (Figure 14). This model adds the species NO2- and N2O and allows two different denitrification pathways: reduction of N2O with organic matter (denitrousation); and reduction of NO2- with NH4+ (deammonification, sometimes known as anammox).

![image9.png](media/candi/image9.png){width="95%"}

Figure 8 The N redox model used in CANDI-AED. Red pathways indicate oxidation by O2, brown pathways oxidation of organic matter by an N species and the blue pathway is NH4+ oxidation by NO2-. Dashed brown lines indicate the release of NH4 from organic matter upon oxidation.

The rate constants and partitioning constants are presented in Figure 15. Organic matter reactions were 2 y-1 for the reaction of POML, for all N redox pathways. The reaction equation is then the product of concentration and the rate constant, hence the final rate is in mmol L-1 y-1. NH4+ was released with each POML oxidised, given by the C:N ratio. The rate of NH4+ oxidation by O2 wa given by kNH4O2, and then the partitioning of reaction products into NO2- and N2O was set by another constant and the O2 concentration. Similarly, the rate of NO2- oxidation of organic matter was 2 y-1, and the partitioning of reaction products was set by another constant and the NO2- concentration.

![image10.png](media/candi/image10.png){width="95%"}

Figure 9 N redox model with the rate constants or partitioning constants drawn over the pathway arrows.

C:N ratio

The C:N ratio was set using parameters for POML and POMR. Eyre et al. calculated C:N ratios in the top 2 cm. The deep mud sites had a ratio around 6.5:1, which indicated the organic matter was close to Redfield ratio, and hence it was derived from phyto-detritus. The seagrass sites ranged from 7:1 to 9:1, and site 12 had a ratio 11.5:1. These higher C ratios indicated that seagrass was the source of organic matter.

The C:N from Zhou et al. was around 9.5 in the mud core CS13 and 8 in the seagrass core MB. The mud core C:N from Zhou et al. did not agree with the mud cores from Eyre et al. It suggested that Zhou et al. found more refractory organic matter than in the core from Eyre et al. The refractory organic matter may be legacy organic matter at this core site.

### Parameterisation of specific environments

#### Deep-dark sediment environment

Deep-dark observations

Most of the area in Cockburn Sound was deep and without seagrass or benthic algae. The cores from Eyre et al. (2025) were cores 1 to 4. These cores contained around 0.5 mmol L-1 chlorophyll. It was assumed this was undegraded phytoplankton and not benthic algae.

The sediments had a total organic matter concentration around 500 to 4000 mmol C L-1 solids, including the legacy refractory organic matter, and an influx of labile phyto-detritus. The cores from these sediments produced a DIC efflux around 8500 mmol m-2 y-1. The C:N ratio was 6.6 to 9.5.

These areas had O2 penetration into the sediment because of the apparently low organic matter influx. Photos from Eyre et al. (2025) suggested that O2 penetrated most of cores 2, 3 and 4, but the amount of bioturbation was not clear. The Pb isotope work from Zhou et al. (2024) indicated a mixed depth to 6 or 10 cm, which suggests that O2 should be mixed to around 8 cm, either by physical mixing or bioturbation. Keesing et al. (2011) reported sediment samples from six sites in Cockburn Sound, with an anaerobic sand depth of 1, 1.5, 2 and 1 cm, as well as one site where the sand appeared aerobic at greater than 10 cm, and one site where the depth could not be determined. Jorgensen et al. (2022) developed an empirical formula for O2 penetration depth (OPD) based on diffusive O2 uptake (DOU), as well as another empirical formula for DOU based on water depth. This 20 m deep environment should have an OPD of around 2 cm. There is enough spatial heterogeneity from these studies that one overall OPD cannot be determined, however, O2 to at least 2 cm is justified.

The deep O2 caused a flux of NO3- out of the sediment, created by the nitrification of NH4+, and the low concentration of NO3- in the water column. As with most sediment environments, there was a flux of NH4+ out of the sediment (around 50 mmol m-2 y-1). Denitrification did not occur at a large scale because O2 inhibited oxidation of organic matter by N species and there was not enough organic matter to reach below the aerated zone. N2 flux was measured at around 200 mmol m-2 y-1.

Legacy refractory organic matter was oxidised by sulfate reduction in the deep sediments below the aerobic zone, and H2S production was indicated by the cores, but not measured.

![image11.png](media/candi/image11.png){width="95%"}

Figure 10 Deep aerobic conceptual model.

Deep-dark processes and assumptions

Deep-dark sediment was the largest part of Cockburn Sound and it had the simplest setup in CANDI-AED. The initial calibration of the Cockburn Sound sediment models was based on this environment. The following rationale was used:

DIC effluxes corresponded to organic carbon oxidation and therefore organic carbon deposition (around 8500 mmol m-2 y-1)

The organic carbon to organic nitrogen ratio was 6.6:1

Organic N was released as NH4+ upon degradation of organic matter. Therefore, there was one NH4+ released for each 6.6 DIC produced

O2 uptake was roughly equivalent to DIC plus oxidation of NH4+, Fe2+, H2S and CH4, if any anaerobic processes occurred

N2 flux should have been around 200 mmol m-2 y-1, according to the measured data. There should have been a small amount denitrification where O2 concentration declined, and did not inhibit denitrification reactions.

The cores had concentration data for TOC%, TN%, TP% and chlorophyll-a (mg m-2 in 2 mm). Eyre et al. measured %COC ranging from 0.2% to 1.9% in the top 2 cm. This converted to around 500 to 4000 mmol C L-1 solids according to the following calculation steps:

Or, as a simpler rule of thumb, 1% TOC was 2250 mmol L-1 solids.

Zhou et al. measured TOC% at 3.0% all the way down to around 45 cm (corresponding to the time period around 1980 to 2018). This converted to around 7000 mmol C L-1. Historically, TOC had a stepped increase in the 1950s from 1.5% to 2%, then in the 1980s to 3% and remains at 3%.

The TOC% measurements being from around 4000 to 7000 mmol C L-1 solids provided us an order of magnitude to set the initial condition. The corresponding TN measurement from Eyre et al. was around 300 mmol L-1 solids, and from Zhou et al. around 500 mmol L-1.

Deep-dark key calibration criteria

Key calibration criteria:

DIC efflux around 8500 mmol m-2 y-1

Aerobic sediment and O2 influx of around 8500 mmol m-2 y-1

NH4+ efflux around 50 mmol m-2 y-1

N2 efflux around 200 mmol m-2 y-1

Benthic algae sediment environment

#### Benthic algae observations

There were areas on the shelf that had benthic algal communities in the sediment. This corresponded with Eyre et al.’s cores 7 and 8. According to Eyre’s lab core experiments, there was a net production of O2 over the course of a day from photosynthesis (more O2 production in the light than consumption in the dark) and hence a net efflux of O2 into the water column. (This was not the usual assumption for fluxes in sediment models.)

Benthic algal communities supplied enough O2 and organic matter that nitrification-denitrification could occur. Unlike the deep sites, there was a net uptake of NH4+ into the sediment from nitrification.

Flux of DIC and O2 at the sediment-water interface should have been very small or close to zero, as measured in the cores. Flux of N2 was around 200 to 350 mmol m-2 y-1 in cores 7 and 8.

CANDI-AED was set up for this environment using the following rationale:

Benthic algal communities were added to the model as a state variable called MPB (microphytobenthos), which grew at kgpp × biomass up to carrying capacity (Figure 5). MPB was quantified in units of mmol C L-1

Carrying capacity was set to 100 mg Chl-a m-2, which, following unit conversions (see below) came to 150 mmol C L-1

MPB assimilated DIC and breathed out O2. At carrying capacity this continued as maintenance

One mole of DIC was absorbed for one mole of O2 exuded

MPB decayed to labile particulate organic matter (POML) at death rate kmpbd × biomass

MPB grew in the light zone (top 2 mm of sediment) and had net primary productivity (NPP) in the light zone. It was NPP because the model did not simulate time at a sub-daily scale

MPB was mixed below light depth by bioturbation

MPB decayed to POML at all depths

Figure 13 Schematic of the concentration of MPB. MPB is mixed deep into the sediment and decays to POML.

The respiration and NPP assumptions were performed as follows:

Total respiration = 17 000 mmol m-2 y-1

(8500 from algal detritus + 8500 from benthic algae)

NPP/R ratio was approximately 0.74 (from the measured data of sites 7 and 8)

NPP was 17 000 × 0.75 = 13 000 mmol O2 m-2 y-1

But O2 flux across the sediment-water interface was close to zero, so the  O2 produced by the MPB was used to oxidise organic matter

The concentration of MPB was calculated as follows:

Benthic algae key calibration criteria

Key calibration criteria:

Total respiration (vertically integrated) = 17000 mmol m-2 y-1

Total gross primary production rate = 13 000 mmol m-2 y-1

DIC flux (at sediment-water interface) = close to 0 net daily flux

O2 flux (at sediment-water interface) = close to 0 net daily flux

N2 flux (at sediment-water interface) = 200 to 350 mmol m-2 y-1

#### Seagrass sediment environment

Seagrass observations

Some areas had seagrass and therefore seagrass detritus as a source of refractory organic matter. The cores from Eyre et al. were cores 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Cores 5 and 6 were from a seagrass restoration area whereas the others were naturally surviving seagrass areas.

The seagrass roots injected some O2 into the upper layers of the sediment. The seagrass detritus also consumed the O2 as it was buried in the deep sediments. Since the organic matter was buried deeper than the aerobic zone, sulfate reduction took place.

There was limited denitrification because it was inhibited by O2 in the root area and inhibited by H2S in the sulfate reduction area. There was still a net efflux of O2 out of the sediment and net consumption of NH4+. The cores that fit this environment did not show either a definite uptake or efflux of NO3- at the sediment-water interface. This environment had high organic matter input and consumption while still having high denitrification (Figure 7), because of the root-injected O2 promoting coupled nitrification-denitrification, as well as the high organic matter load.

N2 flux across the sediment-water interface could be from 100 to 600 mmol m-2 y-1 based on the data from cores 10, 11 and 12.

![image15.jpeg](media/candi/image15.jpeg)

Figure 14 Seagrass environment conceptual model

Seagrass processes and assumptions

CANDI-AED was set up for this environment using the following rationale:

Seagrass had a constant biomass

Roots assimilated DIC and exude O2 in the sediment, at a 1:1 molar ratio (Figure 8)

Roots went down 5 cm and exuded constant O2 with depth and time

Bottom water O2 concentration remained the same as other simulations (around 0.2 mmol L-1) despite photosynthesis from seagrass leaves

Physical sediment mixing rates were the same despite the roots possibly binding the sediment

Seagrass deposited leaf detritus at the sediment-water interface

Seagrass detritus reaction rate constant was 1 y-1 (POML was 2 y-1)

Seagrass detritus influx at the sediment-water interface was calibrated to the respiration rate (starting around 10 000 mmol m-2 y-1 (120 g m-2 y-1))

![image16.png](media/candi/image16.png){width="95%"}

Figure 15 Summary of the conceptual model setup for the Seagrass environment

The respiration rate was calculated as follows:

Respiration: 4000 µmol m-2 h-1 (from the data in cores 9, 11, 12)

= 35 000 mmol m-2 y-1

The overall O2 production ratio to carbon oxidation was (GPP/R) = 1.2 (from the data in cores 9, 11, 12)

NPP = 42 000 mmol m-2 y-1

From the MPB setup, MPB NPP was 13 000 mmol m-2 y-1

therefore roots O2 = 42000 - 13 000

= 29 000 mmol m-2 y-1

Seagrass key calibration criteria

Key calibration criteria:

Total DIC production rate = 35 000 mmol m-2 y-1

Total NPP rate = 42 000 mmol m-2 y-1

DIC flux (at the sediment-water interface) = close to 0 (net daily flux)

O2 flux (at the sediment-water interface) = close to 0 (net daily flux)

N2 flux (at the sediment-water interface) = between 100 and 600 mmol m-2 y-1

### Sensitivity to water quality changes

Seasonal simulation setup

The seasonal setup involved using the dynamic boundary for a year, looped continuously, after the 5 year steady period. (Two years are presented in the results figures.) Dynamic boundary fluxes were POML, POMR, and dynamic boundary concentrations were O2, NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, PO43-, salinity and SO42-. Constant fluxes were used for MnO2 and Fe(OH)3 and constant concentrations were used for DIC and N2. For each sediment environment, this boundary fluctuation was the same. Seasonal fluctuations were not applied to the seagrass detritus.

Low O2 period setup

Dalseno et al. (2024) described how Cockburn Sound was largely well oxygenated, until periods of low wind cause low O2 concentration in the bottom water. To replicate this type of event, a simulation was run with a period of low bottom water O2. The seasonal setup was repeated and O2 concentration dropped from 0.22 to 0.08 mmol L-1 (7 to 1 mg L-1) for 30 days in April (Figure 20). Based on the observations of Jorgensen et al. (2022), lower O2 concentration and should produce a lower O2 flux, while the total organic matter oxidation rate should remain the same.

Figure 16 Concentration-time plot of the bottom water boundary for the low O2 simulation.

High organic matter period setup

To replicate the effect of a one-off pollution or algal bloom event, a higher organic matter flux was added for 31 days in March (100 000 mmol m-2 y-1, Figure 21). An extra POM variable was used, and POML and POMR remained the same as in the other simulations. The seasonally-fluctuating boundary was used.

### Sensitivity to groundwater inflow

Groundwater observations

The equilibrium simulation was extended with groundwater inflow into the deepest layer of sediment. Part of the motivation behind including this environment was the recommendations of Greenwood et al. (2016), who estimated two N flux budgets for Cockburn Sound, with the lower (450 t y-1) and upper (920 t y-1) amount of groundwater setting the difference. Greenwood et al. (2016) set the range based on rainfall variability, following Donn et al. (2015). Greenwood et al. (2016) compared these values to previous estimates of 2100 (for 1978, from CSMC 2001) and 300 t N y-1 (for 2000, from CSMC 2001), which combined groundwater influx with atmospheric and catchment inputs. Greenwood et al. (2016) also mentioned the possible addition of a further 185 t N y-1 from managed aquifer recharge in the future.

As outlined in Table 1, thousands of t y-1 are thought to be recycled in Cockburn Sound, and groundwater represents only hundreds of t y-1. However, groundwater would be the major external flux of TN in this system, given that the atmosphere was around 10 t y-1 and the northern sea boundary was around 51 t y-1. Combined burial and denitrification were proposed to be in balance with the groundwater input, however, there is uncertainty about these amounts. The simulation in CANDI-AED can help to estimate groundwater input, and separately estimate burial and denitrification.

Further, the Greenwood et al. (2016) flux budget assumed that TN would be released from the sediment as NO3- rather than NH4+ or other DIN species. Therefore, another motivation for the CANDI-AED project is to estimate the speciation of DIN from the sediment.

In recent work, Donn et al. (2025) with CSIRO collected groundwater samples and conducted numerical modelling of groundwater, to estimate the groundwater flow and TN species concentration in Cockburn Sound. They conducted several sampling campaigns, along the beach and offshore from a boat. A summary of the concentrations of some of the key variables from each sampling campaign is given in Table 9. A schematic cross-section of the underwater environment with the flow path and sampling locations is given in Figure 18.

Donn et al. (2025) also used a 2D groundwater model to estimate flow velocities, and, combined with the measured concentrations, estimated the loads of key species into Cockburn. Escudero et al. (2026) then used these flows and loads to apply average loads to the CSIEM hydrodynamic model, as well as inputs to CANDI-AED. The model from Donn et al. (2025) predicted very little flow, and therefore load, to most areas of Cockburn Sound. For the years 2021 and 2022, using this method predicted around 60 t y-1, which was much lower than the hundreds of t y-1 estimated by Greenwood et al. (2016).

Figure 18 Groundwater-sediment conceptual model

Groundwater processes and assumptions

This environment was set up by extending the Deep-dark environment with groundwater settings. Benthic algae and seagrass settings were not used, so that the effect of groundwater could be more easily compared.

Four locations were used with groundwater input. Two locations were at the beach, which had high groundwater flow velocity. One at the beach had high DIN loads (Beach high) and the other had low DIN loads (Beach low). Two locations were further offshore (hundreds of m), which had lower groundwater flow velocity. One of these had relatively high DIN concentration (Shelf high) and one low DIN concentration (Shelf low).

Porewater flow was advected upwards at the 30 cm deep bottom boundary, using the poreflow parameter, pf. (The analogue of this at the sediment-water interface is the effective downward advection of porewater from sediment deposition, woo.) Concentrations were added at the bottom-most layer of the sediment as a time-varying boundary, for NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, PO43-, SO42-, DIC and salinity. A summary of area, TN flux and TN load is given in Table 10, along with the groundwater zone referenced in the chapter on submarine groundwater discharge. Concentration values for these variables were taken from the analysis in the chapter on submarine groundwater discharge (Table 10). Example plots of pf and NH4+ are shown in Figure 11 and Figure 12.

## Model calibration and assessment

### Calibration of equilibrium conditions

Deep-dark environment steady results

C and O2 balance

The DIC and O2 fluxes were calibrated to be in balance. The resulting DIC efflux was around 9000 mmol m-2 y-1 (out of the sediment) and O2 uptake was around 8000 mmol m-2 y-1 (into the sediment).

To achieve this balance, the main parameter calibration step was using higher irrigation than the model default option. The initial irrigation parameter (α0) taken from the sediment model of Van Cappellen and Wang (1996) was 200 y-1 and this was increased to 3300 y-1. The purpose of this was to allow mixing of O2 deeper into the sediment. When using the original, lower mixing rate, the sediment and bottom waters were not aerobic and most organic matter was consumed by sulfate reduction. In that case, the O2 flux did not reach a value close to 8500 mmol m-2 y-1: once the concentration of O2 in the top 1 mm of sediment was 0 mmol L-1, O2 could not diffuse into the sediment faster than it could react with the organic matter. There was clearly a high sediment O2 demand, but not a high flux of O2. Increasing the irrigation parameter allowed both demand and flux.

With this irrigation setup and flux result, aerobic oxidation of organic matter and O2 presence were simulated to around 8 cm, which followed the bioturbation settings of exponential decay from the surface to 8 cm. At 2cm, which was the depth mentioned above where we were confident that some O2 should be present, it was around 25% of the concentration at the sediment-water interface.

Redox pathways

With a large amount of O2 mixed into the sediment, this inhibited the other redox pathways (Figure 16). Beneath the depth of O2 penetration, organic matter supply had been mostly exhausted and so the other pathways did not have high reaction rates.

Figure 21 – Left: redox reaction rates for the Deep-dark simulation, primarily aerobic (yellow). Right: favourability of each redox pathway, scaling between 0 and 1, the product of limitation and inhibition.

The organic matter reaction rate was around 500 mmol L-1 y-1 at the sediment-water interface and decreased to zero around 15 cm deep. To check this fundamental step, this rate and depth were compared with similar observations from other key sediment models. Van Cappellen and Wang (1996) had a reaction rate of around 140 mmol L-1 y-1 at the sediment-water interface, decaying to around zero at around 10 cm. The measured data used for this paper were from Canfield et al. (1993) from a site (S4) 190 m deep (Eyre et al. 2025 took cores from 20 m deep). Canfield et al. (1993) measured O2 uptake and total C oxidation at 16.06 and 15.76 mmol m-2 d-1. O2 was measured at 0 below 7 mm. Boudreau (1996) had a reaction rate of around 6 mmol L-1 y-1 at the sediment-water interface. The coastal-estuarine sediment simulated by Wang and Van Cappellen (1995) had an organic matter oxidation rate of 9800 mmol L-1 y-1 (27 mmol m-2 d-1), which was about 70 at the sediment water interface and around 50 mmol L-1 y-1 at 6 cm deep. This comparison showed that the Cockburn simulation included much more organic matter oxidation than similar studies, in order to reach the benchmark 8500 mmol m-2 y-1 DIC flux reported by Eyre et al. Although these studies had a lower total organic matter oxidation rate, these studies also had aerobic oxidation exhausted within the top 1 cm. In these studies, sulfate reduction was the main redox pathway from 2 cm down. One explanation for this difference may be that the hydrodynamic environment was much more energetic in Cockburn.

Figure 22 Depth profile of organic matter oxidation and NH4+ release in the steady Deep-dark simulation

Denitrification

Denitrification occurred, and N2 fluxed from the sediment into the water column at around 200 mmol m-2 y-1, which matched the measured data from Eyre et al. Denitrification efficiency was 44% (N2 flux per DIN flux).

Benthic algae environment steady results

C and O2 balance

The DIC and O2 were again calibrated to be in balance. Respiration (production of DIC) was 17 000 mmol m-2 y-1 and NPP (net production of O2) was 13 000 mmol m-2 y-1 : this meant that most of the organic matter was consumed aerobically. This was achieved by tuning the rate that MPB produced O2 and consumed DIC (312 y-1). This parameter was very sensitive and this system could easily have an imbalance between respiration and NPP in another simulation with different organic matter amounts. O2 flux across the sediment-water interface was measured at very low rates, and the simulation produced a very low O2 flux of 150 mmol m-2 y-1, which captured the measured data well. The DIC flux was measured at around 4000 and simulated at 6000 mmol m-2 y-1.

Redox pathways

The NPP provided O2 in the top 2 mm of the sediment, which maintained aerobic respiration. The extra organic matter from MPB biomass consumed oxidants as well, which allowed for more N redox reactions and sulfate reduction than in the Deep-dark sediments (Figure 20).

Figure 23 – Left: redox reaction rates for the Benthic algae simulation. Right: favourability of each redox pathway, scaling between 0 and 1, the product of limitation and inhibition.

Denitrification

The Benthic algae environments produced a sediment-water N2 flux of around 750 mmol m-2 y-1, which was around three times as much as expected from the measured data. Denitrification efficiency was 54%.

Seagrass environment steady results

C and O2 balance

The DIC and O2 production and consumption were again calibrated to be in balance. Respiration was 35 000 mmol m-2 y-1 and NPP (net production of O2) was 41 000 mmol m-2 y-1, where their targets were 35 000 and 42 000 mmol m-2 y-1, respectively. This was achieved by tuning the rate that seagrass roots produced O2 and consumed DIC (1100 mmol L-1 y-1) and tuning the flux of POMSpecial deposition, as seagrass detritus (17 000 mmol m-2 y-1, reaction rate constant 1 y-1). O2 flux across the sediment-water interface was measured at very low values, and the simulation produced a high O2 efflux of 12 000 mmol m-2 y-1. The DIC flux was measured at close to zero but simulated at 6000 mmol m-2 y-1 into the sediment. Therefore, although the DIC and O2 production and consumption matched the assumptions that went into the design of the simulation, the final simulated flux across the sediment-water interface was larger than the measured values. The DIC efflux of around 6000 mmol m-2 y-1 is still considered an oligotrophic environment, according to the classification from Eyre and Ferguson (2009).

Redox pathways

Aerobic reactions dominated in the top 5 cm of sediment where the roots were present, and then sharply declined below that depth (Figure 21). Sulfate reduction was the dominant pathway below 5 cm.

Figure 24 – Left: redox reaction rates for the Seagrass simulation. Right: favourability of each redox pathway, scaling between 0 and 1, the product of limitation and inhibition.

Denitrification

In between the aerobic and sulfate reducing zones there was a tight band where N redox reactions were possible (see the light yellow lines just below 5 cm in Figure 21). There was just enough O2 available to keep producing oxidised N species that ultimately led to denitrification. N2 flux was around 450 mmol m-2 y-1. Denitrification efficiency was 45%.

### Summary of equilibrium C and N pathways

Overall, these environments had a lot of aerobic oxidation of the incoming organic matter (Figure 20). With a greater load of organic matter from benthic algae biomass or seagrass detritus there was a greater total oxidation rate, and therefore more N redox and sulfate reduction. The greater organic matter oxidation rate was partially compensated by the extra O2 added by the benthic algae and seagrass roots in the top of the sediment.

Figure 25 Above – area plots of redox pathways for each of the environments left to right. Below –area plots zoomed in to the top 15 cm showing only the anaerobic redox pathways.

The main processes of N redox cycling were:

oxidation of NH4+ to NO2- and

oxidation of organic matter by NO2- and N2O.

These pathways promoted denitrification (N2 production) from N2O oxidation of organic matter. These were the largest rate processes seen in the sediment (Figure 26, see also Figure 27 for the map of N redox cycling in CANDI-AED, where these red and brown profiles correspond with the red and brown pathway arrows). The seagrass environment had the largest peak of summed N redox rates at just below 5 cm and they continued to around 10 cm. However, the other two environments allowed these processes to occur from 0 to 10 cm, around twice the depth.

Flux and mass N budgets

The influx of N from algal detritus and seagrass combined for all of Cockburn Sound was 3087 t y-1 (Table 12). For comparison with other budgets, the benthic algal biomass and seagrass can be considered part of the sediment internal cycling, and the POML detritus from the Deep-dark component (2174 t y-1) reflects the load from phytoplankton detritus. Similarly, the organic N input is in line with Greenwood’s estimate of around 2000 t y-1.

The simulated net DIN flux across the sediment-water interface for the whole of Cockburn Sound was 1034 t y-1 from the sediment to the water. The N outflux of 1034 t y-1 is broadly in line with the estimate from Greenwood (2016), who calculated an N flux of around 1500 t y-1. The biggest difference between these results and the result of the Greenwood model is Greenwood’s assumption of a net outflux of NO3-, whereas, according to these results, most of the flux is NH4+ and N2 (430 and 2012 t y-1).

The N2 flux of 2012 is an indication of denitrification. The total of organic N entering the sediment is roughly in balance with the DIN being recycled to the water column and the N2 lost to denitrification (Figure 28). If this were the case, the sediment would be removing total N from the Cockburn system each year, especially since the assumed inputs of N are assumed to be much lower. It is more likely an overestimation of the amount of organic N entering the sediment, calibrated to satisfy the reported amounts of DIC efflux. Although the seagrass was simulated to take up DIN from the sediment pore water, its simulated growth was not limited by low N concentration. This should be included in future simulations of the seagrass sediment environment. Future simulations should more generally examine the settings for organic matter inputs from benthic algae and seagrass leaf detritus. A future coupled simulation could also utilise the water column TN concentrations and benthic algae and seagrass modules, to close the total N loop. Despite these limitations, these results give a useful approximation of general N fluxes and the individual N speciation.

![image37.png](media/candi/image37.png){width="95%"}

Figure 28 Schematic of the N flux budget in t N y-1, approximated to the nearest 1000.

The stores of N were calculated as the sum of all N species then multiplied by their weighted areas, in the top 2 cm of sediment, resulting in 3417 t (Table 13). Greenwood had estimated around half of this amount at 1505 t. All of the uncertainties described above relating to the amount of benthic algae biomass and seagrass detritus apply for this calculation. Another major uncertainty is the amount of refractory organic N in the sediment. Future work can run longer simulations of the 20th century, depositing refractory organic N in the polluted decades and capture the measured amount of deep N, while still maintaining the surface fluxes from recent organic N deposition.

### Sensitivity of sediment processes to water quality events

Seasonal variability results

C and O2 balance

DIC flux was approximately the same as in the steady simulation, but varied around 2000 mmol m-2 y-1, or 20 to 30% seasonally. The Seagrass environment retained the large uptake into the sediment from the steady calibration. DIC concentration was close to the boundary concentration of around 2 mmol L-1 In the seagrass environment, above 5 cm DIC concentration was closer to 1 mmol L-1. From 5 to 10 cm there was the biggest range of concentration (Figure 22).

O2 flux varied around 2000 mmol m-2 y-1, or 20% seasonally. The simulation matched the few measured data points in the Deep-dark and Benthic algae environments, but not the seagrass environment. The Benthic algae environment was fluctuating around net production to net consumption of O2, as the POML boundary flux increased (Figure 23).

N and denitrification

All environments had a net release of DIN (NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, N2O and N2). The three environments had a range of DIN flux of around 250, 1500 and 150 mmol m-2 y-1, and 30, 350 and 5%. Most of the DIN concentration was N2, and the second-most was NH4+ (Figure 24).

Seagrass had the highest total N2 flux, which was also the least sensitive to seasonal fluctuations, since the model had a steady supply of seagrass detritus that was not subject to boundary fluctuations (Figure 25).

Flux and mass budgets

The total mass of N material in the seasonally fluctuating simulations was similar to that of the steady simulation, since the steady simulation was based on an average of seasonal fluctuations (Table 13).

Table 14 N budget fluxes in t y-1 from each sediment environment and the total, during the seasonally fluctuating simulation. In this table, negative indicates flux from the sediment to the water.

Low O2 period results

C and O2 balance

The drop in the O2 boundary caused sediment O2 concentration to drop to 0 mmol L-1 in the Deep-dark environment. The Benthic algae environment had O2 in the top 2 mm where benthic algae were photosynthesising. DIC concentration and flux in the sediment continued unaffected by the drop in O2.

In the Deep-dark environment, during the low O2 event, O2 flux into the sediment was lower (Figure 33). This does not mean that demand dropped, since the organic matter input was the same: organic matter was oxidised via anaerobic processes. In the Benthic algae and Seagrass environments, O2 flux into the water column increased, because of the diffusion from the sediment surface into the water column. Thus, a sediment environment that creates O2, under a water column with low O2, supplies O2 to the water while undergoing more anaerobic reactions. Whether this would have an effect on the O2 concentration of the water column was not determined by this setup and a coupled sediment-water column model would be needed.

Sediment O2 concentration recovered very quickly after the boundary O2 concentration returned. This is a result of the high mixing rate that was calibrated in the initial steady Deep-dark setup. If the boundary O2 drop was the result of less mixing with the atmosphere, the mixing through the water column and at the sediment-water interface may have also been less, and the recovery might have been slower. This would be another experiment that a coupled sediment-water column model could investigate.

N and denitrification

During the drop in O2, the Benthic algal environment had the most prominent increase in DIN flux to the water column, around 300 mmol m-2 y1, or 40% (Figure 34). In the other two environments there was only a small increase compared to the normal seasonal variation. All environments had an increase in NH4+ flux and a decrease in NO2- flux and concentration. The NO2- concentration went close to 0 mmol L-1 in the sediment (Figure 35, Figure 36 and Figure 37). Thus in a situation with no sediment O2, any NO2- present was reacted to N2 and the NO2- was not replaced. With less O2, the NH4+ was not oxidised to NO2- and so NH4+ concentration increased, and hence NH4+ efflux increased.

This shows a mechanism for how a disturbance to the baseline condition led to more NH4+ at the expense of NOx, which is a pattern seen in other scenarios described below. This also shows the temporary increase in denitrification caused by low O2, but also how denitrification ceases after the oxidised N species such as NO2- are exhausted. Eyre et al. (2025) mentioned the necessity of short periods of low O2 for coupled nitrification-denitrification.

High organic matter period results

C and O2 balance

The organic matter pulse created an extra DIC flux of around 50% more than the seasonal variation. The flux returned to its previous state within around 1 month (Figure 34). The effect of the extra organic matter was most clearly seen in the Deep-dark environment, where natural organic matter influx was low and there was no O2 from photosynthesis.

The one-off increase in organic matter concentration created a bigger flux of O2 into the sediment in the case of the Deep-dark and Benthic algae environments, and a smaller flux to the bottom water in the case of the Seagrass environment (Figure 39). The recovery after the event was slower than in the O2 drop simulation, because the extra organic matter was buried as a solid, rather than diffused as a solute.

N and denitrification

The organic matter pulse caused an increased efflux of DIN, most of which was NH4+ and N2 (Figure 40). Since the organic matter persisted in the sediment for around three months, the legacy of higher NH4+ and N2 also persisted for three months (Figure 41, Figure 42). The Seagrass environment did not have a noticeable change in efflux of total DIN or NH4+, however, there was a greater efflux of N2 (Figure 43). This indicated that denitrification could increase, assisted by the O2 supplied to the sediment by the roots.

### Sensitivity of sediment processes to groundwater N inputs

Across the four groundwater environments, in most cases the sediment-water interface fluxes were close to the same as in the baseline Deep-dark environment (Figure 39). One major difference to the baseline was a shift in the N redox chemistry from producing NO3- to more NH4+. As with the low O2 and high organic matter simulations, any disturbance to the baseline shifts this system towards NH4+. As noted in the introduction to this report, Greenwood et al. (2016) had assumed that the sediment supplied NO3- only, however, this simulation produced fluxes of NH4+ at around the same level as NO2- (Table 14). The Deep-dark NO3- flux was into the sediment, and in the Beach high simulation, it oscillated from influx to efflux with the seasonal rainfall on the mainland (Figure 40).

Another difference from the baseline was the increased flux of N2 in the beach environments. N2 flux was nine and six times higher in the beach environments than in the Deep-dark simulation. The well oxygenated water column may have been capable of fuelling nitrification-denitrification reactions, and so extra DIN added to the sediment from the groundwater was removed from the system.

Whereas in the Deep-dark environment, key N variables were concentrated in the top 5 cm of the sediment, the Beach high simulation had these variables concentrated below 15 cm (Figure 41). NH4+ and NO3- accumulated with depth and NO2- had a peak around 12 cm. The N redox reactions continued at the surface but a small peak of extra redox reactions could be seen at around 12 cm (Figure 42).

## Summary

The first major result of this study was the synthesis of Cockburn Sound measured data. This allowed the categorisation of the broader study site into four major types of sediment environment, with the aim of simplifying the system yet retaining the right amount of complexity. This study captured the major processes in three of these four environments.

The question of the legacy organic matter is yet to be answered. The report from Eyre et al. suggested that the DIC flux was mostly from freshly deposited phytodetritus. The results of this model matched this assumption, however, this study did not show how organic matter could accumulate at around 2% TOC in the top 10 cm of sediment and not be buried in the deep sediment.

Development of CANDI-AED through this study led to advances. No other model can simulate benthic algae and seagrass as part of the sediment biogeochemistry. After building the model code to match the conceptual model, CANDI-AED was able to capture the key characteristics of the environment by fine tuning just a few key parameters, for irrigation and O2 production/DIC assimilation in benthic algae and seagrass.

Setting up this model required checking both previous modelling studies and the measured data in Cockburn Sound. As mentioned in the results of the Deep-dark sediment, some assumptions from this study were different to those in previous sediment modelling studies. The irrigation rate parameter was much higher than in similar modelling studies. The total organic matter reaction rate was much higher, as was the amount of aerobic respiration over the anaerobic pathways, compared to similar studies. Unfortunately, the other studies did not report everything that we were able to report here, such as denitrification rates or sediment-water fluxes, and so since the sediment-water fluxes broadly matched the measured data, we assess that the model results were acceptable. We conclude that this environment had a high turnover of material, through both physical mixing of sediment and processing of organic matter.

While the apparent production of DIC (respiration) in the sediment was captured successfully, the flux of O2 and DIC across the sediment-water interface in the Seagrass environment was much too high. This can be improved with recalibration of parameters and amounts of incoming seagrass detritus in future work. The rate of mixing and irrigation in seagrass sediments could also be investigated. At this stage, benthic algae and seagrass were set up to establish the DIC-O2 balance, which indirectly affects denitrification processes through O2 inhibition and coupled nitrification-denitrification. The next step for model development will be to include assimilation of NH4+ and NO3- into biomass, which will likely change the balance of N redox processes and reduce GPP once all the available N is consumed.

The seasonal and one-off simulations showed that the sediment is responsive to deoxygenation and that it also recovers quickly. The N redox simulation in CANDI-AED showed that the drop in O2 led to a greater N2 efflux (indicating denitrification), primarily through less O2 inhibition. There was also a greater efflux of NH4+ and it appeared that any stress to the environment shifted the N redox system to releasing more NH4+. These were results that can be explained by examining the explicit reaction pathways available in CANDI-AED. However, future work would require checking these results against empirical observations.

These seasonal and one-off results can also be investigated with further, similar simulations. By running a range of water column O2 concentrations and durations, and a range of organic matter fluxes and durations, the resulting NH4+ and N2 can be investigated. There may be a simple rule of thumb that can be developed between key variables.

The simulations with groundwater brought more DIN and led to greater NH4+ fluxes. Much of the DIN was denitrified to N2 but there were still greater overall DIN fluxes to the water column from those areas with groundwater intrusion.

The final step in the future work for this project will be dynamic coupling to the water column model. The current version of the water column model has fluxes at the sediment-water interface that are constant in time and for each material zone. Coupling to CANDI-AED will provide a dynamic relationship at the sediment water boundary. It will also provide richer results for the sediment model, which currently has either a constant boundary or one that is hard-coded, and thus unresponsive to sediment flux. For example, if CANDI-AED is currently fluxing NH4+ to the water column, the boundary concentration of NH4+ remains the same. In the future coupled model, there will be a dynamic feedback of concentrations between the water column and the sediment. Coupling with the AED benthic algae and seagrass models will also be a good opportunity.
