<p>The trophic condition of Cockburn Sound has experienced notable shifts from past to present due to variations in nutrient loads, influenced primarily by human activities, such as wastewater discharge and industrial activity, as well as by climate change which have affected catchment flows and groundwater levels. These shifts have dramatically impacted aquatic communities, particularly in algal biomass and seagrass coverage. Nutrient budgeting in Cockburn Sound with a focus on nitrogen as a limiting factor for primary productivity on the Western Australian continental shelf (Koslow et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2011), has been addressed by studies such as CSMC (2001), Greenwood et al. (2016) and Bekele et al. (2023). The importance of nitrogen is underscored in a low-nutrient setting where anthropogenic nitrogen inputs elicit strong biological responses, including algal blooms and reduced water clarity (Hillman and Bastya, 1988; Keesing et al., 2016). Subsequent measures to control nitrogen inputs to the Sound have effectively reduced the total in-water nitrogen concentration to low levels. However, phytoplankton biomass has been slow to respond, and still remains high at some monitoring sites (Keesing et al. 2016).</p>
<p>While the surface water drains and relevant nutrient loads directly to Cockburn Sound has been critically reviewed in Theme 3 (Bekele et al., 2023), the CSIEM model domain spans the WA coastal regions and considers sources beyond direct nutrient input to the Sound but also other nutrient sources such as catchment inputs and wastewater treatment plant inputs. It is important for CSIEM to properly address the nutrient sources and their loads to the receiving waters. It is therefore the aim of this section to provide a comprehensive summary of nutrient inputs affecting the CSIEM domain (including Cockburn Sound), emphasizing their relevance in guiding settings for nutrient source boundary conditions. Subsequent sections will detail these nutrient sources and their respective contributions to Cockburn Sound’s ecosystem dynamics.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> Catchment surface water inputs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#catchment-surface-water-inputs"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Catchment surface water inputs to the CSIEM modelling region include nutrient loads transported from the Swan-Avon catchment via the Swan-Canning Estuary and from the Peel-Harvey catchment through the Peel-Harvey Estuary. Flow rate and water quality data were sourced from the Water Information Reporting (WIR) portal and interpolated into daily intervals to facilitate continuous model simulations. There are no surface water bodies such as rivers, streams or lakes that drain directly to Cockburn Sound, except Lake Richmond (Bekele et al., 2023).</p>
<p>In the case of the Swan-Canning system, the CSIEM model domain spans boundaries at the Narrows and Canning Bridges. To establish total flow through these boundaries, flow rates from upstream locations were aggregated. Water quality observations from the Narrows Bridge (site 6160262) and Canning Bridge (site 6167160) were interpolated to set boundary conditions for nutrient inputs to the Swan and Canning Rivers, respectively.</p>
<p>For the Peel-Harvey system, the flow data used for 1970-2018 was derived from a calibrated catchment model developed in the ARC Linkage project (Hennig et al., 2023). For the period 2019-2024, total flow was estimated by summing flows from gauged rivers within the Peel-Harvey Catchment. Nutrient concentrations at site 6140029, near the Dawesville Cut, were used to define the water quality boundary condition for Peel-Harvey inputs.</p>
<p>The nutrient load reaching the Swan-Canning River is approximately 370 tonnes TN and 10 Tonnes TP per year (Paraska et al., 2021) and reaching the Peel-Harvey Estuary is approximately 630 tonnes TN and 60 tonnes TP per year (Hennig et al., 2023). Despite these significant contributions, direct impacts on Cockburn Sound’s trophic conditions are mitigated by two primary factors: (1) both the Swan-Canning and Peel-Harvey estuaries act as nutrient filters, where primary production and sedimentation processes assimilate and reduce nutrient loads before they exit to marine environments (Paraska et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2023; Valesini et al., 2023); and (2) as these nutrient-laden flows enter the open marine waters beyond Cockburn Sound, they are rapidly diluted, reducing potential impacts on Cockburn Sound’s ecosystems.</p>

</h2>
<p>The CSIEM model domain includes multiple WWTP outfalls, such as those from Alkimos, Beenyup, Subiaco, Woodman Point, Point Peron, and East Rockingham. Since 1984, treated wastewater from Woodman Point and Point Peron WWTPs has been redirected offshore through the Sepia Depression Ocean Outlet Landline (SDOOL), located 4.1 kilometers offshore west-southwest of Point Peron. This offshore discharge through a diffuser that aids in enhancing dilution to minimize nearshore nutrient impacts (BMT, 2014).</p>
<p>Nutrient loads from these WWTPs are recorded in the National Outfall Database (NOD), and were used to set input values in the CSIEM model from 2015 to 2021. Outside this time range, average discharge rates and nutrient concentrations were based on historical data. Summary of average discharge rates, nitrogen loads, and phosphorus loads from each outfall is provided in Table 4.1, which indicate a significant amount of nutrient load to the coastal ecosystem.</p>

</h2>
<p>Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) emerged as a predominant nitrogen source for the Sound following redirection of urban and industrial wastewater outflows to the Cape Peron Sepia Depression ocean outfall (Greenwood et al., 2016). The total SGD nitrogen supply is estimated of between 450 and 920 TN per year depending on annual rainfall, through these estimations may be overestimated and likely to have dropped in recent years (Donn et al., 2015).</p>
<p>Groundwater discharge measurements in Cockburn Sound highlight significant spatial and seasonal variability, influenced by factors such as rainfall and recharge dynamics within the aquifer system (Loveless et al., 2008). Studies utilizing radium isotopes as tracers have shown that SGD rates vary seasonally, with greater discharge occurring following winter precipitation events. This discharge contributes nitrogen to coastal waters, which may exacerbate eutrophic conditions in nearby marine ecosystems (Loveless &amp; Oldham, 2010).</p>
<p>To incorporate the impact of groundwater nutrient loads into the CSIEM model, groundwater flow rates and nitrogen loads along the coastline are derived from regional groundwater model outputs. These flows are assumed to reach the Sound through the sediment-water interface within nearshore zones, distributed among various model polygons as indicated in Figure 3.10.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3.10.</strong> Assigned groundwater seepage polygons overlaid on top of groundwater flow and N-load data from the CSIRO groundwater analysis.</p>
<p>4.4 Industrial inputs</p>
<p>Cockburn Sound is impacted by multiple industrial sources, including BP Refinery, Kwinana Power Station, Cockburn Power Station, Tiwest, and the Perth Seawater Desalination Plant. Despite the presence of these industrial facilities, studies have generally indicated that nutrient contributions from these sources are minimal, especially following the relocation of treated wastewater to the Sepia Depression Ocean Outlet Landline (SDOOL) in 2004 (BMT, 2014 &amp; 2018; Bekele et al., 2023). Current nutrient loads from industrial sources are considered negligible compared to those from groundwater and wastewater treatment plants (BMT, 2023).</p>
<p>For the current study, the CSIEM model configuration mirrors the industrial input settings outlined in BMT (2023), reflecting the limited contribution of these sources in nutrient modeling for Cockburn Sound. Continued monitoring and management are essential to ensure that nutrient inputs from industrial sources remain controlled, supporting the long-term ecological balance in the Sound.</p>

<p>The latest estimates from our field survey suggest that maximum contribution of nutrients from stormwater directly to Cockburn Sound could be less than about 0.1 tonnes/year, though there is a high degree of uncertainty due to sparse observations in stormwater fluxes and their nutrient concentrations (Bekele et al., 2023). Due to the low nutrient load brought by stormwater and its high uncertainty, this nutrient input is neglected in CSIEM.</p>
