Solar heating surface, combined weak tidal mixing reduced wind-driven turbulence, results formation pycnocline separating bottom waters, notable southern region Sound, residence time bottom water longest flushing restricted. contrast, winter months, increased storm activity shift variable northerly winds enhance vertical mixing, eroding stratification replenishing oxygen levels throughout water column.
