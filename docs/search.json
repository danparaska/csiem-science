Comparing estimated past seagrass extent CS 1978 2017 water clarity gradually improved, total seagrass extent follow trajectory modelled habitat remained relatively unchanged. Although habitat model based environmental requirements P. sinuosa past seagrass mapping CS distinguish species except 1999, unreasonable expect total seagrass extent last four decades follow similar trend along light attenuation gradient given ) existing literature (e.g., Cambridge & McComb 1984) 1999 mapping suggested historically almost seagrass CS P. sinuosa (Figure 7.12, Kendrick et al. 2002); b) great deal overlap light requirements among seagrass species CS (see Eftermeijer et al. 2023 summary light requirements several seagrass species also present CS); c) light availability identified primary limiting factor seagrass general CS due water quality issues since industrialisation (Masini et al. 1995).Interestingly, modelled scenario seagrasses heavily epiphytised 45% less light reaching leaves, trajectory habitat area response changing water clarity coincidently agreed mapped seagrass extent last four decades, slope change predicted gentle, .e., change suitable area response per unit change Kd, insignificant, Kd 0.34 m-1 0.23 m-1 (Figure 7.12). trajectory, suitable habitat area increase considerably Kd reduced less 0.18 m-1.important note heavy epiphyte loading scenario, light reduction applied universally across domain illustrate extreme case. likely epiphyte loading past varied spatially temporally resulting overall lighter epiphyte cover, modelled total HSI-weighted habitat area (“epiphytised”) greater actual seagrass extent since fundamental niche species always greater realised niche (Figure 7.12). Following trajectory scenario, original seagrass extent 42 km2 1954 reached even Kd approaches 0.1 m-1, suggesting lighter epiphyte cover back highly probable given fewer eutrophication issues. However, certainly exclude possibility seagrass better health due factors modelled. also possible Kd epiphyte loading correlated extent, since can positively associated eutrophication. may mean periods shortly commencement industrialisation water quality degradation, total habitat area versus Kd relationship followed heavily epiphytised scenario.Given significant influence light availability seagrass health CS demonstrated field studies modelling, worth considering refinements habitat model algorithms light requirements seagrasses. Water clarity varies considerably CSOA throughout year. Based light attenuation measurements 2023 alone (data provided Cockburn Sound Management Council), highest monthly mean Kd (0.28 m-1) occurred July, 47% higher March (0.19 m-1). selection time window suitability assessment therefore change predictions significantly. seasonality Kd also varies year year, refined approach may using rolling average challenging months given year, example. approach also applied wave exposure temperature suitability algorithm. current conditions, temperature limiting factor season, however effects climate change explored future studies, time window selection need refinement. , studies suggested healthy Posidonia energy reserves allow withstand acute shading recover shading removed, particularly susceptible chronic light reduction long-term persistence dependent maintaining positive energy balance (Masini et al. 1995), may option trial longer period year-round integrated light requirement/threshold photoperiod, consider using daily light integral (instead % surface irradiance) accounts daylight hours cloud cover additional turbidity. may also need seasonally varying light thresholds (Said et al. 2024a). means crucial light climate resolved throughout year. wave exposure isn’t limiting factor inside CS, improvement wave prediction, addition validation light climate offer higher confidence habitat suitability predictions OA GR region. also reasonable assume environmental requirement different life stages may differ, example, seedlings may susceptible wave exposure low light event due less established root system smaller energy reserve, respectively, thus additional empirical data assist parameterise suitability model focus restoration site selection.Figure 7.11.
